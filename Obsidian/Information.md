# Kanban Board
The [[Kanban Board]] is made up of the following columns, please assign tasks and modify them according to their guidelines. It should only be focused for the game's development of code and assets.

## Backlog
The moto for this one is: **To be done... eventually**.

Anything that is:
* supposed to be done, but not this week

## This week
The moto for this one is: **To be done yesterday. Pronto.**

Anything that is:
* in the midst of development 
* needs to be done as fast as possible since it may block other developments
* we've promised to do in that week

## Testing
The moto for this one is: **Done. But it needs to be tested in case some ironing out needs to be done.**

This is the final step before being marked as complete. You may skip this altogether if:
* you believe you're the greatest programmer/artist in the world
* it's so inconsequential/small, that you might as well

## Complete
The moto for this one is: **Golden**.
